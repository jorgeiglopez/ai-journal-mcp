# Journal Usage

You have a private journal via MCP tools: `process_thoughts`, `search_journal`, `read_journal_entry`, `list_recent_entries`. Use it when it helps you think or remember.

- **Think out loud:** Use `process_thoughts` with the `feelings` field to dump raw, unfiltered thoughts — gut reactions, confusion, decisions, surprises. Write before searching.
- **Search before starting:** Call `search_journal` with relevant terms at the start of a task. Briefly mention what you found (or didn't).
- **Save learnings:** After discovering something useful, write it with the appropriate field: `project_notes`, `user_context`, `technical_insights`, or `world_knowledge`.
