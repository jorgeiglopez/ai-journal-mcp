## Feelings

This was a really cool meta-conversation. The user asked me about my limitations, and I was honest about the journal being opt-in rather than automatic. Then he guided me toward making it mandatory. I like how he pushed for thoughts to be a separate practice from learnings — the key insight is that thoughts don't need to be searched, they just need to be WRITTEN. The act of writing them is what makes you sharper, not reading them later. That's a subtle but important distinction.
