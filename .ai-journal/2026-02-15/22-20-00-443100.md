## Project Notes

The ai-journal-mcp project uses a date-based folder structure (YYYY-MM-DD) with timestamped markdown files. Each entry has YAML frontmatter with title, ISO date, and unix timestamp. Embeddings are stored as companion .embedding files using the Xenova/all-MiniLM-L6-v2 model. The journal splits entries by scope: project_notes go to the project directory, everything else (feelings, user_context, technical_insights, world_knowledge) goes to the user's home directory.
